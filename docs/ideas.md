Another project idea is a playlist creator with a tinder-esque style. Creating playlists can be frustrating and time intensive. With our site, you’ll create a playlist name and be presented with the album art, song name, and a small clip/demo would play. If u swipe right it gets added to ur liked songs/a playlist, if you swipe left it disappears. You would be able to have friends and they can see you recent liked songs/recently created playlists and make comments and upvote. We would be using audio data, song/album detail data, comment, and playlist data. Spotify/apple music api’s would be used. This site would allow users to create playlists quickly and easily.
