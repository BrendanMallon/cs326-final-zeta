- SPOTLIST
    - This application is a "swipe styled" spotify playlist discoivery tool. Upon sigining in, you can search for playlits based on a term (this can be a genre, description, etc) ans the application will play a snippet of each song in the playlist until you either like or dislike the playlist. If you liek the playlist, it will get added to your spotify account and to your social page so the people in your friends list can see. This is innovative as it creates a simple and quick way to discover playlists while also allowing you to listen to their content in a short ammount of time and automated manner.
